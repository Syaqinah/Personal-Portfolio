<p><center>During the long semester break in my Diploma days, I took the opportunity to start working part time. 
I work at Aeon Big Wangsa Maju for about 6 months which is until my semester break ends. 
Working there taught me a lot of new things that I found very important when entering the working field. 
I treasure my experience as it not only give me working experience, but also gave me everlasting friends.

<center><img src="cook.png" height="200px">
<p><center>After ending semester 4 of my Bachelor's Degree, I went to work at Southville City, Bangi with my friend. 
I found a vacancy at D'Daun Restaurant and work there as a kitchen assisstant. 
I work there for a very short period due to having university duties to handle but it was still an experience I can learn from. 
I learn the different working process in the food industries which is a bit different in retail. 
With these two working experiences I got, I am now a few percent more prepared to face the real working world after graduating my Bachelor's Degree.
